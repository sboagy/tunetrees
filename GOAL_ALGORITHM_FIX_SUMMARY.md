# Goal and Algorithm Display Improvements - Issue #232 Resolution

## Problem Statement
The Goal and Algorithm/Technique columns were displaying historical data from practice records instead of the current user preferences. This caused confusion about what the user's current goals and techniques were for each tune.

## Root Cause
The `practice_list_joined` and `practice_list_staged` database views were pulling `goal` and `technique` from the `practice_record` table (historical snapshots) instead of the `playlist_tune` table (current user state).

## Solution Summary

### 1. Database View Changes
**Files modified:**
- `alembic/view_utils.py`
- `tunetrees_test_clean.sqlite3` (views recreated)

**Changes made:**
```sql
-- OLD: Historical data from practice_record
practice_record.goal,
practice_record.technique,

-- NEW: Current user state from playlist_tune  
playlist_tune.goal,
playlist_tune.technique,
```

### 2. Frontend Changes
**File modified:**
- `frontend/app/(main)/pages/practice/components/TuneColumns.tsx`

**Changes made:**

#### Practice Tab (Read-only display)
```typescript
// OLD: Editable combo box
<RowGoalComboBox
  info={info}
  userId={userId}
  playlistId={playlistId}
  purpose={purpose}
  onGoalChange={onGoalChange}
/>

// NEW: Read-only display
return info.getValue() || "recall";
```

#### Repertoire Tab (Editable)
```typescript
// NEW: Added editable columns for repertoire tab
...(purpose === "repertoire"
  ? [
      {
        // Editable Goal column with RowGoalComboBox
      },
      {
        // Editable Technique column with RowTechniqueComboBox  
      },
    ]
  : []),
```

### 3. Data Behavior

#### Before Fix:
- Views showed historical data from latest practice_record
- User couldn't see current preferences in grid
- Practice tab allowed editing of what should be historical data
- Repertoire tab had no goal/technique editing

#### After Fix:
- Views show current user preferences from playlist_tune
- Historical data preserved in practice_record for analysis
- Practice tab shows read-only current preferences
- Repertoire tab allows editing of current preferences

### 4. Test Verification

**Created:** `tests/test_goal_algorithm_display_fix.py`

The test verifies:
- âœ… Database views have goal/technique columns
- âœ… Views pull data from playlist_tune (current state)
- âœ… Practice records preserve historical data separately
- âœ… Current state â‰  historical state (no confusion)
- âœ… All Issue #232 requirements satisfied

**Test Results:**
```
ðŸ“Š Data verification for tune 634:
  Current state (playlist_tune): goal='fluency', technique='motor_skills'
  Historical state (practice_record): goal='recall', technique='fsrs'
  View shows: goal='fluency', technique='motor_skills'
âœ… SUCCESS: View correctly shows current user state, not historical state
```

## Impact

### User Experience
- **Clarity**: Users see their current goals/techniques in grids
- **Control**: Goal/technique editing moved to appropriate tab (repertoire)
- **History**: Historical practice data still available for analysis

### Data Integrity
- **Current State**: playlist_tune.goal/technique = user's current preferences
- **Historical State**: practice_record.goal/technique = snapshot at practice time
- **No Confusion**: Clear separation between current and historical data

### Developer Benefits
- **Cleaner Logic**: Views show consistent current state
- **Maintainable**: Clear data source responsibilities
- **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for changes

## Files Changed
1. `alembic/view_utils.py` - Database view definitions
2. `frontend/app/(main)/pages/practice/components/TuneColumns.tsx` - UI column behavior
3. `tests/test_goal_algorithm_display_fix.py` - Test coverage
4. `tunetrees_test_clean.sqlite3` - Updated database views

## Issue Resolution
Issue #232 requirements have been fully addressed:
- âœ… Views show current user state instead of historical practice records
- âœ… Practice tab prevents confusing direct editing of goals/techniques  
- âœ… Repertoire tab provides proper editing interface
- âœ… Historical practice data preserved for future analysis
- âœ… No more confusing one-to-many relationship display in grids
