# TuneTrees: Tune Repertoire Practice Assistant

TuneTrees is designed to help folk musicians efficiently memorize and retain a large repertoire of tunes. By combining proven memory techniques like spaced repetition, mnemonics, and spatial navigation, the app assists in training musical memory. In the future, TuneTrees may explore the use of advanced technologies like neural networks and reinforcement learning to further enhance the memorization process.

See the [Tune Trees Project Whitepaper](docs/core-proposal.md#tune-trees-project-whitepaper)
to get some insight into the vision of the project.

## 1. Design and Intent

TuneTrees is a web application with a backend server that manages user data and schedules reviews. The backend securely stores all data in a database, while the frontend handles user interactions like login, account management, and practicing tunes. The frontend communicates with the backend using an HTTP API to access and update user data. Both the frontend and backend are packaged as containers and deployed together using Docker Compose on a DigitalOcean server.

### 1.1. System Structure

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the TuneTree architecture.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Backend (container)"
        direction LR
        A(Backend Server) --> B(Database)
        A --> C(Review Scheduler)
    end
    subgraph "Frontend (container)"
        direction LR
        D(Frontend) --> E(HTTP API)
    end
    subgraph "Client"
        direction LR
        I(Browser) --> D
    end

    E --> A
    D --> F(User Management)
    D --> G(Tune Practice)
    D --> H(Login/Logout)
```

### 1.2. Technology Usage

This diagram maps out the basic technology used. Specific implementation details may evolve.

        D --> E
        E --> F
        F --> G
    end
    E --> A
    G --> A
```

#### 1.2.1. Frontend:

Handles user interactions, including login, account management, and tune practice.
- HTTP API: Communicates with the backend to access and update user data.
- User Management: Handles user registration, login, and account settings.
- Tune Practice: Provides tools for practicing tunes and tracking progress.
- Login/Logout: Implements authentication and authorization.

#### 1.2.2. Backend:

Handles user data management, review scheduling, and API requests.
- Database: Stores user data, including tunes, practice history, and review schedules.
- Review Scheduler: Determines when tunes should be reviewed based on the user's progress.

### 1.3. Schema:

The database is organized as follows: Each user can have multiple playlists, and each playlist is associated with a specific musical instrument. These playlists contain tunes, which are stored separately and shared across all users. TuneTrees doesn't aim to be a complete tune repository, so it only stores basic tune information. For more detailed details, users can refer to external resources.

The complete entity relationship diagram is illustrated by the following diagram:

### 1.4. Alternatives or Potential Technology Evolution

1. Down the line, I can switch to MySQL or PostgreSQL if needed.
2. For the front end, I may experiment with a Kotlin frontend at some point.

### 2.1. Generation of ORM code

The SQLAlchemy ORM code is contained in the `tunetrees/models` package in the `tunetrees.py` 
module.  It should always be generated with the following procedure:

First, make sure you have [sqlacodegen-v2](https://pypi.org/project/sqlacodegen-v2/) installed:

```bash
pip install "sqlacodegen-v2 ~= 0.1.4"
```

Then, generate the `tunetrees.py` python file which will contain the TuneTrees ORM code.

```bash
sqlacodegen_v2 sqlite:///tunetrees.sqlite3 > tunetrees/models/tunetrees.py
```

Then remove the extra `from sqlalchemy.orm.base import Mapped` line from the generated code.

Finally, make sure the new code is properly formatted for the project.

> [!NOTE]
> For the moment, both `black` and `ruff` are being invoked, which is just the author 
> trying to hedge his bets.

```bash
black tunetrees/models/tunetrees.py &&  ruff check --fix --select I tunetrees/models/tunetrees.py && ruff check --fix tunetrees 
```

#### 2.1.1. VSCode Processes  (ðŸš§ This Section a Work in Progress ðŸš§)

To install and set up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for this project, follow these steps:

1. Download and install VSCode from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Open VSCode and install the following extensions:
    - Python: This extension provides support for Python development. You can install it by searching for "Python" in the Extensions view and clicking on the "Install" button.
    - Docker: This extension allows you to work with Docker containers directly from VSCode. Search for "Docker" in the Extensions view and install it.
    - Remote - Containers: This extension enables you to develop inside a Docker container using VSCode. Install it by searching for "Remote - Containers" in the Extensions view.

3. Clone the TuneTrees project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tunetrees.git
    ```

4. Open the project folder in VSCode:
    - Click on "File" in the menu bar.
    - Select "Open Folder" and navigate to the location where you cloned the TuneTrees repository.
    - Click "Open" to open the project in VSCode.

5. Set up the development environment:
    - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by clicking on "View" in the menu bar and selecting "Terminal" from the dropdown menu.
    - Run the following command to create a virtual environment for the project:
      ```bash

      ```
    - Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the TuneTrees application.

Now you have VSCode installed and set up for the TuneTrees project. You can start coding and contributing to the project using the powerful features of VSCode.


#### 2.1.2. Run and Debug in VSCode  (ðŸš§ This Section a Work in Progress ðŸš§)

To run and debug your project using `.vscode/launch.json`, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. In the VSCode sidebar, click on the "Run and Debug" icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).

3. Click on the "Create a launch.json file" link or select "Add Configuration" from the dropdown menu.

4. Choose the appropriate configuration for your project. For example, if you're working with a Python project, select "Python" as the configuration type.

5. VSCode will generate a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` directory of your project.

6. Open the `launch.json` file and configure the necessary settings for running and debugging your project. This may include specifying the entry point file, command-line arguments, environment variables, and more.

7. Save the `launch.json` file.

8. To run your project, click on the "Run" button in the VSCode toolbar (or press `F5`). VSCode will execute your project according to the configuration specified in `launch.json`.

9. To debug your project, set breakpoints in your code by clicking on the left margin of the code editor or pressing `F9`. Then click on the "Debug" button in the VSCode toolbar (or press `F5`). VSCode will start your project in debug mode and pause execution at the breakpoints you set. You can inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the program's behavior.

10. Use the debugging controls in the VSCode toolbar to navigate through your code and control the debugging session. These controls include stepping into functions, stepping over lines, stepping out of functions, and stopping the debugging session.

By following these steps and configuring the `launch.json` file, you can easily run and debug your project in Visual Studio Code.

### 3.1. Basics

    - Docker.
    - Multi-Platform Cross Compilation
    - Docker Compose
    - buildx bake

### 3.2. Build

    - docker buildx bake
    - docker buildx bake frontend
    - docker buildx bake server

### 3.3. Deploy

This section provides step-by-step instructions for deploying TuneTrees using Docker containers. The deployment process covers both local Docker container management on a laptop and deployment on a DigitalOcean droplet where the app is hosted. To ensure HTTPS protection, a proxy server container is used, which requires access to PEM certificates.

Please note that when we refer to "deploying," we mean running the application in Docker containers rather than in a development environment. While it is possible to deploy for production in a non-containerized environment, this project currently focuses on containerized deployments.

If you are not already familiar with Docker and Docker Compose, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of these technologies before proceeding with the deployment process.

#### 3.3.1. Deploy to Local Docker

For local deployment to Docker containers, these instructions have been tested with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on a MacBook Pro with an M3 chip and 48 gigibytes of memory.  

> [!NOTE]
> The author has chosen not to use [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) at the moment because he believes it may have limitations when it comes to cross-compiling to platform-specific containers. However, it is quite possible that there is a way to configure Rancher Desktop for cross-compilation. Other desktop container options such as [Podman](https://podman.io/) may also be feasible. 

##### ***3.3.1.1. Make local certificates***

We recommend using `mkcert` to generate self-signed certificates into a local 
`dhparam` directory.  To install `mkcert` follow these steps:

**For macOS:**

Install `mkcert` by running the following command in your terminal:

```SHELL
brew install mkcert
```

**For Linux:**

Install `mkcert` by running the following commands in your terminal:

```SHELL
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools
wget -O mkcert https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.3/mkcert-v1.4.3-linux-amd64
chmod +x mkcert
sudo mv mkcert /usr/local/bin/
```

**For Windows:**

Install `mkcert` by following the instructions on the official website: [https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation)

**Install localhost certificates**

Once `mkcert` is installed, the certificates can be created as follows:

1. Create the `dhparam` directory and `cd` into it:

```SHELL
mkdir -p dhparam
cd dhparam
```

2. Generate the self-signed certificates by running the following command:

```SHELL
mkcert localhost
```

This will generate the `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` files in the `dhparam` directory.

##### ***3.3.1.2. Use Docker Compose to deploy using webserver_local***

To deploy the application locally using Docker Compose with a local https ngnx proxy, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory based on the [frontend/template.env.local](https://github.com/sboagy/tunetrees/tree/main/frontend/template.env.local) template.  Replace 
the IDs and secrets, specifid by the angle-bracketed values, with the correct secrets.  You can supply
your own secrets, or, if working as part of the project, you can obtain these secrets from the 
1Password vault assigned to the project, or get them directly from this project's administrator.

Obviously ensure that no secrets are ever checked into the github repository.

4. Build the Docker images by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```

5. Start the Docker containers in detached mode by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose up server frontend webserver_local -d
    ```

    This command will start the `server`, `frontend` and `webserver_local` services defined in the `compose.yaml` file.

6. Wait for the containers to start up. You can check the logs by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

    This will display the logs from both the `server` and `webserver_local` containers.

7. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the TuneTrees application by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

    Note: The `webserver_local` service acts as a reverse proxy and forwards requests to the `server` service running on port 8000.

8. To stop the containers, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This will stop and remove the containers, but preserve the data in the SQLite database.

By following these steps, you will be able to deploy the TuneTrees application locally using Docker Compose with the `webserver_local` service.


#### 3.3.2. Deploy to Digital Ocean Droplet
