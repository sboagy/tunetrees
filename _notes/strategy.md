# Strategy

Very incremental, by hook/crook try to make it useful enough for my own practice.

- [ ] Simple as possible GET/POST endpoints.
- [ ] via simple web page, Jinja2 template, display my practice list
- [ ] Display in basic schedule order (and no sets functionality)
- [ ] Add radio button per row to say which is being practiced
- [ ] Post feedback, text entry number and button
- [ ] Update list
