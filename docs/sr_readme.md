# Spaced Repetition Terminology

Spaced repetition is a powerful learning technique that helps you retain information over time. Here's a breakdown of key terms used in spaced repetition systems:

## Core Concepts:

- Interval: Time between reviews of a specific item.
- Review: Revisiting information to reinforce memory.
- Due card: Card scheduled for review at a specific time.
- Lapse: When a card isn't reviewed within its scheduled interval.
- Efficiency: How well a spaced repetition system works (correct reviews / total reviews).
- Retention: Your ability to remember information over time.

## Advanced Concepts:

- Smoothing: Adjusting the interval based on learner performance.
- Forgetting curve: Model describing how quickly information is forgotten.
- Adaptive algorithms: Algorithms that adjust intervals based on individual performance.
- Interleaving: Mixing different types of items in reviews for better retention.
- Active recall: Actively trying to recall information before it's presented.
- Spaced practice: A broader term encompassing spaced repetition and other learning techniques.

## Popular Systems & Software:

- Leitner system: A popular spaced repetition system using a card-sorting method for intervals.
- Anki: A widely used spaced repetition software application.
- SuperMemo: Another popular spaced repetition software application.

## More Esoteric Terms:

- Adaptive interval scheduling: A specific type of algorithm used in spaced repetition systems.
- Cumulative learning: Building on previous knowledge to learn new information more effectively.
- Decay rate: The rate at which information is forgotten over time.
- Flashcard effect: Overconfidence and decreased retention due to repeated exposure.
- Forgetting curve equation: A mathematical equation modeling the forgetting curve.
- Interpolated intervals: Intervals adjusted based on learner performance in previous reviews.
