## Core Features

### 📚 Repertoire Management

Organize your tunes with flexible playlists:
- Create multiple playlists for different instruments or genres
- Add tunes from the built-in catalog or create custom entries
- Track metadata: title, type (jig, reel, etc.), mode, structure
- Mark tunes as learned, in-progress, or to-learn

### 🎯 Spaced Repetition Practice

Intelligent scheduling based on the FSRS algorithm:
- Daily practice queue automatically prioritizes tunes needing review
- Rate your recall after each tune (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)
- Algorithm adjusts review intervals based on your performance
- Never forget a tune again!
