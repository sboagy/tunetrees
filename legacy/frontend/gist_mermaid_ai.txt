Create a "tune ingress or edit flow" diagram.  The user can either create a new tune, or import a tune from irishtune.info or from theSession.com, or edit an existing tune, all of which take the user to a TuneEditor form.    The major data entities are the `tune` table and the `tune_override` table, but also the `reference` table which contains a url and a `tune_ref` field referring to a `tune` id.  Tunes can either be public or private, it is set to private with a `private_for` column.  When a tune is imported, it is automatically made public by the app, and any edits the user applies will be made to the  `tune_override` table entry for that tune.  If a tune is new, the `private_for` field is automatically set to that user's id.  Also, if a tune is new, a fuzzy search will occur to see if there are close matches, and a list of those matches will be shown to the user when they try to submit the tune.
