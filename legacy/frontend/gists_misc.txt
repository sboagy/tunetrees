1. **Check CSRF Endpoint**: Manually check the CSRF endpoint by navigating to 
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/csrf` in your browser. Ensure it returns a valid JSON response.

2. **Check Session Endpoint**: Manually check the session endpoint by navigating to 
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/session` in your browser. Ensure it returns the current session data.

3. **Check Sign-In Endpoint**: Manually check the sign-in endpoint by navigating to 
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin` in your browser. Ensure it initiates the sign-in process.

4. **Check Sign-Out Endpoint**: Manually check the sign-out endpoint by navigating to 
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/signout` in your browser. Ensure it initiates the sign-out process.

5. **Check Callback Endpoint**: Manually check the callback endpoint by navigating to 
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` in your browser. Ensure it handles the callback from the authentication provider.

I should also note that `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/csrf`, `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/session`,
`https://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin`, and `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/signout` all 
seem to be wired correctly.  But `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/credentials` returns a 
"InvalidProvider: Callback for provider type (credentials) is not supported. Read more at https://errors.authjs.dev#invalidprovider"
message but a think that's normal since The credentials provider in NextAuth does not use a callback route.
