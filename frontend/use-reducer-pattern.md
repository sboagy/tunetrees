Ok, it works now, and is testing pretty well.  Now the question, is this good code.  Or is it a bit obscure?  i.e. is it following good practices?

Let's analyze the current implementation:

Good aspects:
1. Separation of concerns - TunesTableComponent handles table creation and state management
2. Custom hook (useTunesTable) abstracts the complexity
3. Proper handling of loading states
4. Clear data flow from parent to child components

Areas that could be improved:

1. **Complex State Management**:
   - The table creation involves many pieces of state (sorting, filters, visibility, etc.)
   - Could benefit from a reducer pattern to manage related state updates

2. **Implicit Table Creation**:
   ```typescript
   const [tableComponent, table] = useTunesTable({...});
   // ...
   return (
     <div>
       {tableComponent}  // Hidden table creation happening here
       // ...rest of UI
     </div>
   );
   ```
   This pattern is a bit magical/unclear. A more explicit approach might be:

   ```typescript
   const TableStateManager = ({ onTableCreated, ...props }) => {
     // All the table state management logic here
     return null;
   };

   function ScheduledTunesGrid() {
     const [table, setTable] = useState(null);
     
     return (
       <div>
         <TableStateManager
           {...props}
           onTableCreated={setTable}
         />
         {table ? <ActualContent table={table} /> : <Loading />}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Error Boundaries**:
   - The current error handling could be improved with proper React error boundaries

4. **Performance**:
   - The table is recreated whenever props change
   - Could benefit from more memoization

5. **Type Safety**:
   - Could be stricter about null checks
   - Could use discriminated unions for loading states

A more idiomatic approach might be to:
1. Make the table management more explicit
2. Use a reducer for complex state
3. Split into smaller, more focused components
4. Add proper error boundaries
5. Add performance optimizations

Would you like me to show how any of these improvements could be implemented?
