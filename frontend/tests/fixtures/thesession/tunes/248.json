      "content": "Actually, I agree with you, Jeremy -- I think it IS a bit of a cheap trick.    I generally don't do the stair-stepping thing, and only play it in one or the other key.  But it's a pretty simple tune to learn and sounds impressive, so it's great for a session when you're trying to keep everyone together -- changing the key up makes it sound a little more impressive, so it's great to motivate a beginner with.    But the tune itself is great.  I prefer it in Aminor, actually, but that's probably because I hate my current set of strings on the low end, plus my fiddle has bad lower end response.  It's also a great tune to dance to...it's one of our consistent favorites in dance class.    You'll probably not find anyone playing it in a session in Bm, glauber, although it'd be fun for a performance!    Zina",

I love the way the fiddle soars on the B part of The Silver Spire.)    I was trying to hit a few notes as the tune whizzed past on the CD(gotta get that slow-down software sometime!), and I think they were playing Tam Lin up a whole step from how it is transcribed here.

You see, I live in Israel, and John McSherry was a guest artist in our annual Irish Festival, and one evening he joined us to a session. I feared to touch my tin whistle, for I was paralysed with awe. At some point I asked one of the Israeli musicians to play The Glasgow reel, as it was my favourite. But John refused, for some reason, which we couldn't understand (utterance issues, I suppose...). After some time I asked him myself to play it. I could hardly pronounce the syllables, as English is not my mother tounge, but mostly because I feared to talk to His Lordship, and was amazed by his loveliness. You know, the regular stuff. He refused again (I was not too charming then, I believe). Why? Well, He played it thousands of times with his first band, the late Tamalin, and he has a trauma! Even the tune's title- \"Tam Lin\"- brings back dark memories... So, if one day one of you joins this sweet mind-twisted lad, don't menbtion this tune.

      "content": "Len - As a confirmed pedant, I take it as my responsibility to point out a minor error in your chord sequence: you appear to have missed out one bar of Dm in the B-part. I presume, what you meant was:     ||:Dm/// | Bb/// | C/// | Dm/C/ | Dm/// | Bb/// | C/// | C/Dm/ :||  ||:Dm/// | Dm/// | C/// | C/// | Dm/// | Dm/// | Bb/// | C/Dm/ :||    Since much of this tune is based on arpeggios, the chords are pretty much laid out for the backer. But this also makes it more difficult to find alternative chords to prevent monotony. Without getting too 'experimental', this might work as a slight variation:    ||:Dm/// | Bb/// | C/// | Dm/C/ | Dm/// | Bb/// | C/// | Am/Dm/ :||  ||:Dm/// | Dm/// | C/// | C/// | Dm/// | Dm/C/ | Bb/Gm/ | Am/Dm/ :||",

When I wanted to play that tune in A and B minor during the last session I was told, it's in D minor!   I checked the seesion.org and see this 'awful' notes for tin whistle.

      "content": "This is probably one of those questions where everyone will have a different answer, but I'll ask anyway. I'm a beginning fiddler and I'm trying to learn Tam Lin (The Glasgow, Howling Wind, whatever). I am wondering if there is a \"standard\" way to bow the first couple of bars.    The first three bars have one quarter note and then six eighth notes each. If I bow each note separately, then the second bar is bowed the reverse of the first and third. Is this usual? Or is there a standard way to ensure that I start each of the first three bars on a downbow (i.e. which two notes do I slur together)?    Thanks in advance!",

In the case of this tune, an F whistle is the easiest option, and doesn't involve any half-holing at all (unless you play some C-sharps in the B-part - but they're not too challenging), since it is in the Aeolian mode.  But it depends on the compass of the tune.  The A-part of Tam Lin fits very comfortably on a C whistle, without any half-holes (if you cross finger the B-flat), but the B-part takes you up to D in the 3rd octave, which, if you .can get there at all, is very shrill.    Pipewatcher:\" it's a bit tricky but not as tricky as all the half-hole stuff trying to do it on a C\"    Where's all the half-holing?  There are only the optional C-sharps in the B-part.  The only problem on the C-whistle is the range.",

      "content": "Most tunes that are supposedly in Am are not really. They are more likely to be in A dorian (with an F#). As such you would probably be better with a D whistle than a C whistle in that case.    In terms of which whistle to pick for particular keys the range is going to matter a lot. For example there are plenty of tunes in G that you would not play on a G whistle because they go below the range. On the other hand they are a piece of cake on the D whistle.    Really the simple D whistle is flexible enough to play a vast range of tunes in all the standard keys and a few non-standard keys - all I need to do now is learn to play it!!",

      "content": "Which version of 'Tam Lin' are you playing?  The 1 posted here is 2 parts & is playable on an F whistle.  There are different versions & variations. So depending on which one you are playing will effect your choice of whistle.  I learned the tune from a 4 - parter which modulates in the last 2  parts. On that version I play a C whistle (bringing some of the low notes up an octave). I tried the version posted as \"The Galway\" & it seems fine on my F whistle.  I'll listen to the recording I learned it from since I have not played the tune in many years.",

I knew it was by Davey Arthur and know it as \"Tam Lin\" which (rightly or wrongly) was said to be a corruption of Tamberlaine.  Not sure about the \"Glasgow Reel\" but think it was given this title by someone who didn't know what it is called, which of course could be the case with any of the different names (although I believe \"Tam Lin\" was the original title.  Someone asked about a tune to lead into \"Tam Lin\" and much further up the page and before the question was asked \"The Islay Reel\" was mentioned.  Don't know if it's the same tune but I remember we used to play \"The Islay Ranters' Reel\" before \"Tam Lin\".  Don't ask me about keys - I'm a drummer.",
