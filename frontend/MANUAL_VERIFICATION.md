# Manual Verification Test for Recall Quality Menu Bouncing Fix

This document provides steps to manually verify that the recall quality menu bouncing issue has been resolved.

## Prerequisites

1. Backend server running on http://localhost:8000
2. Frontend dev server running on https://localhost:3000
3. Browser with developer tools

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Basic Functionality
1. Navigate to https://localhost:3000
2. Login if required
3. Go to the Practice tab
4. Verify that recall quality dropdowns are present in the table
5. Click on a recall quality dropdown
6. Verify it opens without bouncing
7. Select a quality rating
8. Verify it closes properly and saves the selection

### Test 2: Rapid Clicking (Bouncing Prevention)
1. Navigate to the Practice tab
2. Rapidly click a recall quality dropdown 3-5 times quickly
3. **Expected**: The dropdown should open/close smoothly without oscillating
4. **Before Fix**: The dropdown would bounce open/close multiple times
5. **After Fix**: The dropdown should debounce and settle into a stable state

### Test 3: Multiple Tabs Open (Original Issue Context)
1. Open multiple tabs in the same browser
2. Navigate to the Practice tab in one tab
3. Click on recall quality dropdowns
4. Switch between tabs while dropdowns are open
5. **Expected**: Dropdowns should not bounce when switching tabs
6. **Before Fix**: Tab switching could trigger bouncing behavior

### Test 4: Blur/Focus Events
1. Open a recall quality dropdown
2. Click outside the dropdown to close it
3. Quickly click on another dropdown
4. **Expected**: Smooth transition between dropdowns
5. **Before Fix**: Could cause rapid open/close cycles

### Test 5: Async Operation Timing
1. Open a recall quality dropdown
2. Select a quality rating
3. Immediately try to open another dropdown
4. **Expected**: No interference between async save and UI state
5. **Before Fix**: Async save could cause dropdown to reopen unexpectedly

## Technical Validation

Check browser console for:
- No error messages related to state updates
- No warnings about memory leaks or cleanup issues
- Smooth execution of selection handlers

## Performance Check

With developer tools open:
1. Monitor React DevTools (if installed) for unnecessary re-renders
2. Check Network tab for proper API calls on selection
3. Verify no excessive timeout/interval creation

## Success Criteria

✅ Dropdowns open/close smoothly without bouncing
✅ Multiple rapid clicks are handled gracefully  
✅ Tab switching doesn't affect dropdown behavior
✅ Async operations don't interfere with UI state
✅ No console errors or warnings
✅ Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Code Changes Summary

The fix implemented:
1. **Debounced state management** (50ms timeout) to prevent rapid oscillation
2. **Immediate popover closure** before async operations 
3. **Removed problematic table refresh** that was causing reopening
4. **Proper cleanup** for timeout handles
5. **Optimistic updates** for better user experience

## Files Modified

- `frontend/app/(main)/pages/practice/components/RowRecallEvalComboBox.tsx`
- Added debouncing logic and cleaned up async operation handling
