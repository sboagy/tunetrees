"""
Integration test for Goal and Algorithm display improvements (Issue #232).

This test verifies that:
1. Database views use playlist_tune.goal/technique (current user state) instead of 
   practice_record.goal/technique (historical state)
2. The views correctly show current user preferences while preserving historical data
3. The solution addresses the core issue of displaying current vs historical state

Changes implemented:
- Modified practice_list_joined view to pull goal/technique from playlist_tune
- Modified practice_list_staged view for consistency
- Updated frontend to show read-only goal/technique in practice tab
- Added editable goal/technique columns to repertoire tab

This addresses Issue #232: "Improve Goal and Algorithm in views, grids, and display and edits in grids"
